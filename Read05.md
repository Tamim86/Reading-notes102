# For Loop:
### Reapeats until a condition is *False*
### consist of [initialexpression], [condition], [increment]
### *let x= 0*
### *for (x < 10)*
###  *console.log (Hi)*
### *x+=1*

# Do... While Loop
### Iterate until condition is *False*

### * Do statement*
### * while condition* 

# While Loop:
### Iterate as long as a condition is *True*

### while (n < 3) {
  ### n++;
  ### x += n;
### }

### We use *While Loop* when we dont know how many times we need to Iterate

We use *For Loop* when we know how many times we need to iterate
